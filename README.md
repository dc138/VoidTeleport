# VoidTeleport

Minecraft Spigot plugin for preventing players from falling into the void on hub / lobby servers.
Allows you to run custom commands as the player being teleported.
Tested support includes bukkit, spigot, and paper builds from minecraft version `1.13` to `1.20`.
Support for newer server versions, and other forks have not been tested, but due to the plugin's simplicity it will most likely work out of the box.

Note: this plugin does not collect any kind of statistics through `bStats` or any other custom telemetry / statistics server; and never will.

## Usage

This plugin is very simple.
Firstly, a server administrator uses the `voidteleport` command to setup the spawn location.
Then, all players who fall into the void (height under a configurable threshold), are automatically teleported there.
Configuration is persisted in a `config.yml` file under `plugins/VoidTeleport/`.

### Commands

`/voidteleport`, or `/vtp`: manage the plugin.
Usage: `/<command> [reload|set|test]`.
  - `reload`: reloads the configuration.
  - `set`: sets the spawn location to your current location and orientation.
  - `test`: test the spawn location by teleporting you to it.

### Configuration

The following configuration entries are used:

- `spawn`: configured spawn world, location, and orientation for players.
- `void_height`: height below which players are considered to be in the void.
- `command`: optional command to run when teleporting a player. You may use `%player%` as a placeholder for the player's name
- `caller`: who to call the custom command as. Supports `player` and `console`.
- `hide_output`: whether to try and hide the output of the command when calling it as the player **only**. *Warning*: using this option will not work on vanilla commands.

Remember to use `/vtp reload` after making configuration changes.
Possible config options are documented more in depth in the config file itself.

### Permission nodes

- `voidteleport.manage`: full access to the `/vtp` command and subcommands. Given to server operators by default.
